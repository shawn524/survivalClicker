# Survival Clicker

An incremental game with a post apocalyptic twist

## Things to add:
- Random NPC encounters like travelling merchants
- Random weather events like dust storms 
- More structure upgrades
- Some kind of in-game clock
- A WAY better interface

- An end game?




## Things added: 
- Supply gathering
  - You have a weighted-random chance to find either food, water, ammo, scrap, a medpack, or nothing at all
- Days survived. 
  - Each supply gathering click adds to the days you have survived

- The player has attributes you need to monitor and tend to
    - Health
    - Hunger
    - Thirst
    - Rad exposure
  - If one of these becomes too high, the player can become:
    - hungry
    - thirsty
    - sick
    - starving
    - dehydrated
  - Hungry, thirsty, and sick are lesser status effects and will each increase the status multiplier by 1.5x
  - Starving and dehydrated are greater status effects and will each increase the status multiplier by 2x
  - You will need to eat, drink, or heal these conditions back down to manageable levels

- Random combat events
  - After a certain set of conditions, enemies will now attack you
  - You can attack (with a gun/ammo) or run away
  - They will shoot at you
  - Combat is based on your offense(weapons) and defense(armor) and theirs as well (pre-defined based on the type of enemy)
  - If you kill them they have loot and it becomes your loot

- Structures
  - You can now build 3 different structures with found scrap
- Upgrades to the structures
  - You can now upgrade those structures with item storage.
  - Will add other types of upgrades down the road
- Rare loot drops like weapons and armor
  - After a certain number of days survived, you now have the chance to find weapons and armor while roaming the wastes
- Item storage in your home base
  - You can store items in your built storage upgrades.
  - It's only function so far is if you die, and you have a certain number of medpacks in storage, you manage to live (somehow)

- Death
 - If health reaches 0, you die

- A terrible interface. 
  - Seriously it's awful and I need to work on it more
