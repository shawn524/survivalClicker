# Survival Clicker

An incremental game with a post apocalyptic twist

## Things to add:
- Random NPC encounters like raiders and travelling merchants
- Random weather events like dust storms 
- Structures
  - Upgrades to the structures
- Rare loot drops like weapons and armor
- Item storage in your home base
- 



## Things added: 
- Supply gathering
  - You have a weighted-random chance to find either food, water, ammo, scrap, a medpack, or nothing at all.
- Days survived. 
  - Each supply gathering click adds to the days you have survived.

- The player has attributes you need to monitor and tend to
    - Health
    - Hunger
    - Thirst
    - Rad exposure
  - If one of these becomes too high, the player can become:
    - hungry
    - thirsty
    - sick
    - starving
    - dehydrated
  - hungry, thirsty, and sick are lesser status effects and will each increase the status multiplier by 1.5x
  - starving and dehydrated are greater status effects and will each increase the status multiplier by 2x
  - You will need to eat, drink, or heal these conditions back down to manageable levels.

- Death
 - If health reaches 0, you die. 

- A terrible interface. 
  - Seriously it's awful and I need to work on it more.
